# Dalle-2 x GPT-3 Meme Generator for class competition

Auto meme generator using GPT-3 (generate pretrained transformers) which generates a descrptive image prompt and an caption for the meme based off of user input. The descriptive image prompt is then used to create an image using DALLE-2 diffusion model and then the 2 are put together.

# Tech stack

This project uses a mix of typescript and javascript NextJS with axios for API requests (npx create-next-app@latest).

I also use Github Codespaces for remote programming and Github CLI to push changes.


# Time it took

It took about 20 minutes to make the entire thing so it's not perfect. It was also done in a distracting class which makes it harder to focus.
